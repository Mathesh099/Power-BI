### Overview:

- The ``` Sales Report Dashboard ``` is an analyzed report of customer, products and orders fields taken from the sample excel datasets in which I used eight charts namely, 
  ``` Slicer chart | Map chart | Card chart | Q&A chart | Table chart | Line chart | Clustered bar chart ``` . The year slicer is used to filter out the entire report to the respective selected year. Same as year slicer the country, city slicer and ship via slicer is used to filter out the enitre report. 

- And for country, city slicer I created a new hierarchy named location where it consists of country and city. And coming to the map chart it visualize the order amount  for location hierarchy field. By turning on the drilldown option we can visualize the city wise order amount. To showcase the highest order amount of country and city I used order amount as size. The larger circle in the map chart indicate the country or city with highest order amount. The clustered bar charts shows the top 5 products and customers by order amount. In top 5 products chart we can drilldown to see the top 5 product type name, product name and product class. The line chart is a most trendy and widely used chart to visualize the sales by date hierarchy range. And additionally I used drillthrough in the line chart where we can drillthrough by right clicking the line chart to see the detailed report for the desired date range. The card chart is used to display the total sales or order amount. LAST BUT NOT LEAST the Q&A chart is used to raise a question related to the fields, by pressing CTRL key + CLICK.
